**Trimester Two (School Assistance Project)**

Project Description (Ideation + Purpose):
The overall idea of our website is to assist all DNHS individuals in their educational experiences in both learning and teaching through effective organization and productivity. We have two modes, for students and teachers, allowing them to document each day through the usage of calendars, planners, quick feedback, etc.

This is helpful to new teachers who might want to reference things about our school quickly or who might want to take attendance quickly. It gives students and opportunity to plan well and lets them know what they have to do each day, as well as allowing them to quickly communicate with peers and teachers.

**Trimester Three (Emergency/Survival Methods Project)**

Project Description: Our goal this trimester with our website is to make a helpful and viable alternative to phyiscal manuals during an evacuation. We hope to convert all paper necessities into an online format as well as add other pages that would make evacuating on short notice easier. Overall, we hope to make the hassle of evacuation as simple and least stressful as possible.
